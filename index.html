								<h1>Fish Stocking Map of Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park</h1>
								<p>We brought an innovative solution to get the latest <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/34b21920b4b04591844f8b44a17eb4c4">Fish stocking data</a> and <br />
								a StoryMap showing the highlights and changes of the Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7f74a6c796da4a8a9c80d392286cc07c">Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park.</a> </p>

								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\intro.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This was a group project to fulfil the requirements of the course GEOM099 which required to plan out a problem statement and
								frame a web GIS solution. The final ouput of the group project will then be a web GIS solution.</p>
								
								<p>In this project, we were expected to explore the available web technologies as a group. 
								This was a five-week project where we had to figure out a problem statement and come up with
								a web solution. We had to demonstrate how that particular web solution would be 
								effective in solving that particular problem. This project also required us to maintain individual 
								logs so that the work timeline could be monitored and noted. </p>
							</article>

								<h2 class="major">Problem Statement</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\ps.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Intially to start the project we had to identify a problem statement. A problem statement is basically a concise description of an issue to be 
								addressed. The problem statement had several parts to it. The very first part was to identify the ideal followed by the reality and the consequences of the project and its impact. At last we had to write down a proposal of what output we were to
								provide by the end of the project. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Ideal</h3>
								<p>Using open source data from Ontario GeoHub, we want to utilize historical fish stocking data within Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park - from here we can navigate 
								to a dashboard that allows the user to move around the map and see annual stocking numbers over time. This can also be used in a Story Map format that provides a descriptive historical background. 
								Prioritize the Dashboard, Story Map if time allows.</p>
								
								<h3 class="major">Reality</h3>
								<p>Ontario currently runs on Fish ON-Line, a meteocre design that has gaps in data and manuevarability. This new interactive dashboard could potentially provide new opportunities 
								as a template for other parks to do the same moving forward.</p>
							
								<h3 class="major">Consequences</h3>
								<p>The public may be unaware of the opportunities for outdoor recreation that Kawartha Highlands Provincal Park provides and may never see the parks beauty.  
								Furthermore, there is no way to currently view historic stocking data for Kawartha Highlands Provincal Park.</p>
							
								<h3 class="major">Proposal</h3>
								<p>Present an interactive map that can be used to find fishing spots in Kawarth Highlands Park and easily view the stocking history.  
								The story map will also highlight the history and popular attractions of the park.</p>
							
								<h3 class="major">Technology Used</h3>
								<p>ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards, Story Map. Basically we used the ESRI software to execute the web portion of the project</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Deliverables</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\bg.JPG" alt="ESRI Basemap showing the Kawartha Highland Provincial Park" /></span>
								<p>For the final output of the project we planned out two major deliverables which were a dashboard marking the fish stocking in the lakes present in the Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park
								and a Story Map that will communicate the highlights and history of the park.</p>
							
								<h3 class="major"><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/34b21920b4b04591844f8b44a17eb4c4">Fish Stocking Dashboard</a></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Dashboard1.png" alt="ArcGIS Dashboard showing the Zoomed in Section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>This Dashboard designed to display the fish stocking history for each lake. It shows the latest stocking data of all fish species combined with historic stocking data to give a full stocking history.
								This dashboard has three major segments which are a map highlighting the Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park, followed by a pie chart showing the share of a particular species of the fish present in the particular area. At last is the table which shows the species of the fish 
								name of the lake and the quantity which was stocked in each particular lake. All of this is geographically linked so when you zoom in on the map all the data on the pie chart and the table automatically change according to the area visible on the map </p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Dashboard2.png" alt="ArcGIS Dashboard showing the Zoomed in Section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>This Map was created by using the shape file of the area of Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park and all the data available on the government websites regarding fish stocking. </p> 
									
								<h3 class="major"><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7f74a6c796da4a8a9c80d392286cc07c">Kawartha Highlands Story Map</a></h3>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\storymap1.png" alt="ArcGIS Dahboard showing the Zoomed in Section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>This is a Story Map solution available by ESRI in which we can present a story line with maps and geospatial data. For this solution we hosted WebMaps on ArcGIS Online and then used that data and put it on the Story
								Timeline. So the timeline present here in this storymaps shows how the park changed with time and how the boundary area of that park differed. Furthermore, the story map shows the highlights and history of the Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park. </p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\storymap2.png" alt="ArcGIS Dahboard showing the Zoomed in Section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>These are basically two maps overlayed each other, they both depict the boundary of Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park. These two maps are differenciated 
								by a slider by which the left part of the map denotes the old boundary and the right side of the slider denotes the current boundary. </p> 
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\storymap3.png" alt="ArcGIS Dashboard showing the Zoomed in Section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>This map in the image shows all the fishing points present in the area, and even marks the dominance of the species of fish present in that area</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\storymap4.png" alt="ArcGIS Dashboard showing the zoomed in section Kawartha Highlands Park" /></span>
								<p>This map displays the Trapping Zones divided in the various management areas, as this shows how many zones are within the park boundary. </p>

								<p>Joshua is currently enrolled in the Geographic Information Systems: Cartographic Specialist program at Sir Sandford Fleming College â€“ School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences and has recently graduated from the Conservation Biology Technician Program at the same location. These programs highlight the importance of GIS in conservation, and how to maintain conservation efforts through effective monitoring programs, healthy ecosystem management, and cyclic studies surrounding at-risk species. He has a working knowledge and understanding of ArcGIS Pro, AutoCAD, and other related software. On top of his experience in the forestry field, Joshua has also allocated time to volunteer through various board opportunities including the Frost Student Association (FSA), Fleming Bird Conservation Committee (FBCC), and the Canadian Cartographic Association (CCA). These positions have helped refine communication skills and the ability to be an effective leader, while gaining hands-on experience in a working environment.
